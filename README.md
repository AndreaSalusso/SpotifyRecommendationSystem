# SpotifyRecommendationSystem

## Project Introduction:

With the growth of the internet and social media, music data is growing at an
enormous rate!

Music analytics has a wide canvas covering all aspects related to music. Machine
learning has taken a central role in the progress of many domains including music
analytics.

Faster computational speed and increasing number of online users have resulted in a
dramatic increase in music consumption.

It is getting more and more difficult for the general public, especially non-experts, to
find and retrieve music from the millions of songs available online. Currently, there are
several musical retrieval and similar artist recommendation apps.

We decided to start working with machine learning by managing music datasets to
discover interesting patterns and give us the opportunity to expand our knowledge in
this tricky but very interesting world
